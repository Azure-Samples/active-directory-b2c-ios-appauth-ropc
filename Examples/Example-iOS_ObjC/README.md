# Example Project

## Setup & Open the Project

1. In the `Example-iOS_ObjC` folder, run the following command to install the
AppAuth pod.

```
pod install
```

2. Open the `Example-iOS_ObjC.xcworkspace` workspace.

```
open Example-iOS_ObjC.xcworkspace
```

This workspace is configured to include AppAuth via CocoaPods. You can also
directly include AppAuth as a static library using the build targets in the
`AppAuth.xcodeproj` project.
